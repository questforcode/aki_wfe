    <h1>Lycoris Radiata, or Red Spider Lily</h1>

    <img src="./Assets/higanbana.jpg" alt="A red spider lily over a green background.">

    <p>Each fall right at the time of the equinox splashes of brilliant crimson appear 
    along the roadsides and rice patties of southern Japan. These are the flowers of the 
    red spider lily, <strong>Lycoris radiata</strong>. Like many plants associated with Japan and its people, 
    this flowering bulb is another transplant from China. In Japan it has become culturally 
    significant for religious, cultural, and even practical reasons. Like many members of this small genus, 
    it has an odd genetic history and apparently much of its distribution is the result of human hands.</p>

    <p>It’s Japanese name is higanbana, meaning “the other shore flower”, from the Buddhist term higan 
    (“other shore”) and Japanese bana meaning “flower”. “The other shore” is Nirvana, where earthly matters 
    are “blown out” and replaced with enlightenment and nonphysical existence. Since L. radiata happens 
    to bloom during ohigan, a time when people travel to their ancestor’s graves, it is associated with 
    the dead, and to a lesser extent the autumnal equinox.</p>

    <p>Because higanbana blooms without leaves, is <em>blood red</em>, often grows near graveyards, and flowers
    exactly at the time of ohigan, its flowers are thought to be the departed souls who are on their way to 
    “the other shore”. It is also said that the souls are being guided by the flowers to paradise. Another Japanese 
    name for it is manjushage, which is a flower found “in paradise” and derived from Chinese legend. The stories 
    spun around this flower are nearly endless.</p>
