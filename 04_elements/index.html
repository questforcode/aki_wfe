            <h2>Metadata</h2>

            <p>The metadata we have learned to use are:<em> meta</em>,<em> title</em>,<em>
                    link</em>,<em> script</em>, and<em> style</em>. They are all explained inside
                the comments of the head.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Block Elements</h2>

            <div>

                <h3>Sectioning</h3>

                <p>The elements that are reflected in the web page's outline, just like
                    the chapter titles of a book.</p>
                <p>Before <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language"> HTML5</abbr>, these elements were the <em>body</em>
                    and <em>headings</em>.
                    This was an implicit sectioning. However, in HTML five, we have new semantic elements.
                    These explicit sections are: <em>section</em>, <em>header</em>, <em>footer</em>,
                    <em>nav</em>, <em>article</em> and <em>aside</em>. We can organize as we want.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>section: very specific section defined by the user;</li>
                    <li>header: exactly what the name says, there can be as many as needed
                        but only one per section;</li>
                    <li>footer: exactly what the name says, there can be as many as needed
                        but only one per section;</li>
                    <li>nav: a special section that allows us to establish navigational
                        elements such as menus;</li>
                    <li>article: sections you consider interesting independently, like blogs;</li>
                    <li>aside: side information, newsletter stuff, extras etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Grouping</h3>

                <p>The elements that are not reflected in the web page's outline, like the
                    contents of a chapter in a book.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>p: pragraphs, literally what it says;</li>
                    <li>pre: already formatted paragraphs, respects the format you give it in the code;</li>
                    <li>blockquote: a quoted paragraph, avoid plagiarim you doofus. indents by default. attribute cite
                        to link the source of the quote, and att title to name it;</li>
                    <!--use either title or cite as attributes, or cite as a tag inside a footer
                        you can also write headers inside the blockquotes. use classes to differentiate
                        if you don't want it recognized as an h tag in the structure.-->
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="header">Fancy!</p>
                        Look at this, it is a cool blockquote!
                    </blockquote>
                    <li>ul: unordered list, appearing by unnumbered symbols;</li>
                    <li>ol: ordered list, appearing by numbers/ order choice;</li>
                    <!--&gt;li*n-->
                    <li>dl: definition list, they don't have items, they have item pairs (definitions and terms)
                        dt: term, dd: definition. not much in use;</li>
                    <li>div: a neutral block. helps with categorizing things in classes and ids for
                        later use during CSS. full freedom and almost always has a class;
                    </li>
                    <li>address: an html5 new block. a special type of paragraph that are used for author data /
                        address;
                    </li>
                    <li>main: an html5 new block.[tbc]</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

            <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

            <div>
                <h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
                <p>They correspond to the 'a' tag with the attribute href to indicate the url.
