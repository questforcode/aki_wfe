        <h2>Metadata</h2>

            <p>The metadata we have learned to use are:<em > meta</em>,<em> title</em>,<em> 
            link</em>,<em> script</em>, and<em> style</em>. They are all explained inside
            the comments of the head.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Block Elements</h2>

            <h3>Section</h3>

                <p>The elements that are reflected in the web page's outline, just like 
                the chapter titles of a book.</p>
                <p>Before HTML5, these elements were the <em>body</em> and <em>headings</em>.
                This was an implicit sectioning. However, in HTML five, we have new semantic elements.
                These explicit sections are: <em>section</em>, <em>header</em>, <em>footer</em>,
                <em>nav</em>, <em>article</em> and <em>aside</em>. We can organize as we want.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>section: very specific section defined by the user;</li>
                    <li>header: exactly what the name says, there can be as many as needed
                    but only one per section;</li>
                    <li>footer: exactly what the name says, there can be as many as needed
                    but only one per section;</li>
                    <li>nav: a special section that allows us to establish navigational
                    elements such as menus;</li>
                    <li>article: sections you consider interesting independently, like blogs;</li>
                    <li>aside: side information, newsletter stuff, extras etc.</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h3>Grouping</h3>

                <p>The elements that are not reflected in the web page's outline, like the 
                contents of a chapter in a book.</p>
    </section>

    <footer>
            <p>Author - Navi</p>
    </footer>
